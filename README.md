# Lucky Numbers!
### What is a lucky number?
A lucky number is any integer which can be expressed as the sum of integers whose reciprocals add to one  
Take for example 11  
11 = 6 + 3 + 2  
1 = 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/2  
This means 11 is Lucky!  
So are 1, 4, 9, 10, 11, 16 and many more numbers

### What does this repo do?
This repo is mostly a practice project for me to get my feet wet in rust but it is also a...
console application that can help you find and get ways to construct lucky numbers  
find lucky numbers that have multiple constructions  


### You can also plot stuff
using the plot command you can plot the luckiness of numbers to a file using the plotter library
