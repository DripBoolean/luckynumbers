# Lucky Numbers!
### What is a lucky number?
A lucky number is any integer which can be expressed as the sum of integers whose reciprocals add to one  
Take for example 11  
11 = 6 + 3 + 2  
1 = 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/2  

### What does this repo do?
This repo is mostly a practice project for me to get my feet wet in rust but it is also a console application that can help you find and get ways to construct lucky numbers  

### You can also plot stuff
using the plot command you can plot stuff to a file using the plotter library
